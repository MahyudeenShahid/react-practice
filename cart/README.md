# cart

A small shopping-cart style demo built with React and Vite. This project demonstrates rendering lists, toggling item state (added to cart), passing props, and simple UI composition.

## Purpose

Use this project to practice building a collection-based UI and simple cart interactions.

## What you'll learn

- Rendering lists with `Array.map` and using `key` props
- Managing collections and toggling boolean flags (e.g., `added`) using `useState`
- Passing data and callbacks between components (lifting state up)
- Basic component composition and styling

## Files to look at

- `src/App.jsx` — contains the `products` array and main layout
- `src/components/Nav.jsx` — navigation/header component
- `src/components/Card.jsx` — displays product cards and actions

## Run locally

```powershell
cd cart
npm install
npm run dev
```
