## Purpose

A small demo that shows adding and removing cards/items in a list. Good for practicing list rendering, controlled forms, and state updates when working with arrays.

## What you'll learn

- Rendering lists with `Array.map` and `key` props
- Adding/removing items from arrays in state (immutable updates)
- Controlled form inputs for creating new items
- Lifting state up to share data between components

## Files to look at

- `src/App.jsx` — main app and container for the cards
- `src/components/` — card components and any form components used to add items

## Run locally

```powershell
cd cards-Adding
npm install
npm run dev
```
