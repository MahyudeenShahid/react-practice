# redux

Example project demonstrating global state management patterns in React (Redux or alternatives). Use it to explore how actions, reducers, and store interact with components.

## What you'll learn

- Core Redux concepts: actions, reducers, store
- Connecting components with hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) or `connect`
- Organizing state and reducers for larger apps

## Files to look at

- `src/` — look for `store` setup, reducers, and components connected to the store

## Run locally

```powershell
cd redux
npm install
npm run dev
```
