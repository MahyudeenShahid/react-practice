# first_react_app

A small beginner React project using Vite. This project demonstrates the basics of React components, JSX, state with `useState`, and simple event handling.

## Purpose

This project is intended as a first hands-on introduction to React. It's intentionally small so you can focus on core concepts without extra tooling.

## What you'll learn

- Creating functional components with JSX
- Using `useState` for local component state
- Passing props to child components
- Handling user events (clicks, form input)
- Project structure with Vite

## Files to look at

- `src/App.jsx` — main application component
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry and mounting point
- `components/` — small presentational components (Button, Counter, Nav)

## Run locally

Make sure you have Node.js installed (LTS recommended). Then run:

```powershell
cd first_react_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).
