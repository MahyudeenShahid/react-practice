## Routing

A small demo showing client-side routing with React Router (or a similar router). Use this to learn how to create multi-page experiences without a server round-trip.

## What you'll learn

- Basic setup of React Router
- Defining routes and nested routes
- Linking between pages and reading route params

## Files to look at

- `src/` — look for router setup (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route)

## Run locally

```powershell
cd routing
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Exercises

- Add a 404 page
- Add dynamic routes with parameters
